# SolSentinel

**SolSentinel** is an intelligent monitoring and advisory system for Solana validators. It performs health, configuration, and security checks on your validator, helping you maintain high performance, minimize downtime, and protect your stakers.  

#### SolSentinel helps you:

- Detect early signs of performance degradation  
- Identify configuration or system issues
- Monitor validator security posture
- Stay proactive to protect your stakers and uptime
- Build trust with your stakers through transparency and reliability

## Coming soon  
- Advanced checks
- More notifcation options
- Package update summaries
- Action suggestions

## Usage
1. Clone the repo   
2. Use the scripts  

### Running Checks

Run the main script with:

```bash
python3 run_sentinel.py [OPTIONS]  
```

Options include:

--skip-fail2ban Skip the fail2ban check  
--skip-package-updates Skip the package updates check  
--skip-ssh-check Skip the SSH security configuration check  
-q or --quiet Suppress detailed output and only show final summary  
--env-file Path to custom .env file (default: .env)

Make sure the script is run with sufficient permissions so that it can access system information and run commands like sysctl.    

### Discord Setup (Optional)
1. In the root directory (`config-check/`), copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Edit `.env` and add your Discord webhook URL:
   ```
   DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL="your-discord-webhook-url-here"
   ```
   
   You can also set the webhook URL as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL="your-discord-webhook-url-here"
   ```

## The Checks  

#### Package Updates Check  
Ensures the number of pending OS package updates stays within an acceptable threshold.  

- **Purpose:** Up to date packages are critical for security and stability.  
- **Recommended Action:** Regularly apply updates to keep the system fully patched. However, don't use auto update as you need to review changelogs and ensure change only occur in maintenance windows.

---

#### Reboot Required Check  
Detects whether a system reboot is needed to complete the installation of critical updates (such as a new kernel or core library).  

- **Purpose:** Guarantees that all security fixes and functionality improvements are actually active by confirming that any required reboot has been performed.  
- **Recommended Action:** Schedule and perform a reboot whenever this check reports "required" to ensure the system is running the latest code.  

## Flows
### Update Firedancer flow  
```sh
cd ~/SolSentinel/actions

# Schedule a maintenance window and stop the validator before replacing it.
sudo systemctl stop frankendancer.service

# Fetch the release and install its dependencies. Approve the deps.sh prompt
# if asked. Run as the validator user; using sudo is also supported.
./update-firedancer.sh v<version>

# Build Firedancer. This typically takes about 3.5 minutes.
./make-firedancer.sh

# Confirm the built version matches the requested release.
~/code/firedancer/build/native/gcc/bin/fdctl version

# Initialize the updated configuration and start the validator. The configure
# script requests sudo internally while retaining the validator user's HOME.
./configure-firedancer.sh
sudo systemctl start frankendancer.service

# Confirm the service is healthy.
sudo systemctl status frankendancer.service
sudo journalctl -u frankendancer.service -n 200
```
The update and build scripts do not reboot the server. Reboot only when an OS
update or configuration change separately requires one.

If you see a log like: ***pack cpu 5 has hyperthread pair cpu 29 which should be offline. Proceeding but performance may be reduced.***. Fix with the command below for each instance:
```sh
echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu29/online
./start-firedancer.sh  
```
